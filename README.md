This is a project intended to ultimately produce a community-driven, not-for-profit tier list for the mobile tower defense game Arknights. The tier list, the site it is hosted on, and the underlying code is not to be used in an exclusive or profit-driven manner. It is intended to provide a source of information, discussion, and entertainment, but is not to be treated as inherently factual due to the subjective nature of tier lists. None of the works associated with this project are associated with Arknights, Hypergryph, Studio Montagne, or Yostar Games. All work associated with this project is currently undertaken by sharquado.
